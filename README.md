There are two categories of requirements that were defined in order to clearly identify what needed to be done to align the functionality with the previously defined strategy.

Structure

The website has been organised in a hierarchical tree structure to allow users to navigate the site easily and efficiently, with the following results:

Skeleton

Wireframe mock-ups were created in a balsamiq workspace with providing a positive user experience in mind.

Design

1. Typography

A combination of Roboto and Lato fonts is used throughout the website, with Sans Serif as a back-up font in case of import failure.
For elements that needed to be highlighted, bold, italic, and underlined were used with the aim of emphasising these elements.

2.	Colour scheme

The main colours used on the site are a mixture of blue and green, with purple accents.
The chosen (cool) colour palette reflects peace, is appreciated for its restful qualities, and evokes calmness and freshness. Cool colours have a very soft effect and are generally considered to be the colours of the night. They are the colours of nature, water and inspire sobriety, calm and relaxation.

3.	Imagery

The selected imagery and video are authentic and aesthetically consistent, showing an overview of what is happening at Afya Centre. The imagery is eye-catching and visually represents the theme of the website.

All images provide alternative text for use in the event that the element cannot be rendered. The template used to provide alternative text for the background images can be found here.
