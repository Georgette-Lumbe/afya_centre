4. Provide a communication channel for new and existing customers (social links - easily accessible on the site)

### Scope

There are two categories of requirements that were defined in order to clearly identify what needed to be done to align the functionality with the previously defined strategy.

1.	Content Requirements:

    * The user will be looking for:
         The different services and treatments offered
        o The coaches available
        o Information about price
        o The location of the centre
        o Photos and video
        o How to book
        o Social links
        o Contact details

2.	Functionality Requirements:

    * The user will be able to:
        o Stay connected 
        o Find links to external sites in order to get more information, to see more photos, videos, and testimonials
        o Navigate easily through the site to find the information they want.
        o Contact the centre directly through the communication channel of your choice.
        o Find the route to the centre (all locals).

### Structure

The website has been organised in a hierarchical tree structure to allow users to navigate the site easily and efficiently, with the following results:

### Skeleton

Wireframe mock-ups were created in a balsamiq workspace with providing a positive user experience in mind.

## Design

1. Typography

* A combination of [Pangolin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pangolin?query=pangolin) and [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/?query=raleway) fonts is used throughout the website, with Sans Serif as a back-up font in case of import failure.
* For elements that needed to be highlighted, bold, italic, and underlined were used with the aim of emphasising these elements.

2.	Colour scheme

* The main colours used on the site are a mixture of blue and green, with purple accents.
The chosen (cool) colour palette reflects peace, is appreciated for its restful qualities, and evokes calmness and freshness. Cool colours have a very soft effect and are generally considered to be the colours of the night. They are the colours of nature, water and inspire sobriety, calm and relaxation.

3.	Imagery

* The selected imagery and video are authentic and aesthetically consistent, showing an overview of what is happening at Afya Centre. The imagery is eye-catching and visually represents the theme of the website.

* All images provide alternative text for use in the event that the element cannot be rendered.
